**URL:** https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/en/data-and-facts/evaluation-tables-on-the-energy-balance/

## Description

Aggregated energy balance time-series tables summarizing key energy statistics for Germany, including primary energy consumption, production & foreign trade, energy consumption by sector, renewables share, electricity generation & other transformations, final consumption by sector and energy source. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## Temporal coverage

1990–2024 (latest update as of September 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## Geographic coverage

Germany — national scope. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

## Data contents / Variables (general)

- Primary energy consumption by energy source (coal, oil, gas, renewables, nuclear, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
- Primary energy production and foreign trade by energy source :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
- Structure of energy consumption by sector (industry; households; services; transport; other) :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
- Renewable energy share within the energy balance; use of energy sources for electricity generation; combined heat & power (CHP) generation :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
- Final energy consumption by sector and energy source for industry, households, trade/commerce, services, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

## Format & Access

- Data provided as downloadable evaluation tables (e.g. PDF or spreadsheet) on the AG Energiebilanzen website. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
- Publicly accessible; latest version (as of 2025-09) covers data up to 2024. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

## Organization / Publisher

AG Energiebilanzen, a long-standing working group for energy statistics and balances in Germany. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

## Notes / Methodology & Usage Considerations

- The evaluation tables compile processed, quality-assured national statistics, combining multiple official and industry data sources. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
- Data expressed in petajoules (PJ), percentages, and optionally as coal-equivalent (tce) to facilitate cross-carrier comparison. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}
- Useful as a reference baseline for energy system analysis, longitudinal studies, energy policy evaluation or emissions estimations.
- Si usas solo un subconjunto (por ejemplo solo renovables o electricidad) conviene documentar ese recorte en tu metadata personal.
