**Resource:** Energy Balance 2000 to 2030  
**URL:** https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/en/data-and-facts/energy-balance-2000-to-2030/  

## Description  
Annual energy balance reports for Germany, covering energy supply, production, trade, transformation and consumption by energy carrier and sector. Includes detailed breakdowns of primary energy production & consumption, imports/exports, transformation (electricity, heat, etc.), and final energy consumption across sectors. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Temporal coverage  
From year 2000 onward (with archived older years where available). Latest releases include 2021–2023. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Geographic coverage  
Germany — national level data. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Data contents / Variables (general)  
- Primary energy supply, production and trade by energy source (fossil, nuclear, renewables, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Energy transformations (electricity generation, heat, combined heat & power (CHP), transformations from fuels) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Final energy consumption by economic sector (industry; households; commerce and services; other) and by energy carrier :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Renewable energy contribution, shares of renewables in energy mix, sectoral breakdowns, energy flows (PJ, % and coal-equivalent) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Format & Access  
- Data downloadable from the provider website; usually provided as annual reports / tables (PDF, spreadsheet, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Data publicly available via AG Energiebilanzen site, no paywall. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Organization / Publisher  
Publisher / maintainer: AG Energiebilanzen (Working Group on Energy Balances, Germany) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Notes / Methodology & Usage Considerations  
- Data compiled by combining official statistics, industry-provided data and association data; includes quality assurance, corrections and consistent methodology over time. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- Includes conversions to comparable units (e.g. joules) to aggregate different energy carriers, transformations and final consumption flows. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- When using for modelling or comparison over long time spans, check for structural breaks or methodology changes documented by AG Energiebilanzen. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
